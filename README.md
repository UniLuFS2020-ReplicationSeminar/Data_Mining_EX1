# CE1: Quality of Government Analysis
Class EX 1 with Miguel, Patrick, Tobias

In this class exercise (CE1), we use the dataset Quality of Government provided by the Quality of Government (QoG) Institute at the University of Gothenburg.

## Research Question

What are the drivers of the percentage of women in parliament (lower and single houses)?

## Empirical Hypotheses

We hypothesize that:
- Greater levels of democracy will result in a higher percentage of women serving in parliament.
- There are fewer women in parliament in nations with a higher percentage of adherents of Islam.
- Real GDP per capita should have no effect on the percentage of women in parliament.

## Methods

We use visualizations and linear regression models to analyze data from 2010.

## Results

The results include a boxplot and regression plots.
