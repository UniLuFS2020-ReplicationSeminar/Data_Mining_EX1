## Introduction

For this excersise we will be using the dataset **Quality of Governnment** Dataset.
Data from 1946 to 2021 with a country-year unit of analysis are available in a Basic Time Series (TS) dataset provided by the Quality of Government (QoG) Institute at the University of Gothenburg. The dataset contains both historical and contemporary versions of various nations. Data for nations prior to their independence is excluded, and factors with sparse coverage are eliminated. Basic descriptive numbers and a bar graph showing the availability of data for each year are provided in the codebook.
You can find the codebook [here](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/Data_Mining_EX1/blob/f8314e3e5aef74dd7a3f3a26b7e0ffe7b2a4d3c3/data/codebook_bas_jan22.pdf).


### Research Questions

Based on the dataset we wanted to compose the following research questions:

1. Is there a relationship between the level of democracy and the share of women in lower and single houses of parliament?
2. How does the percentage of adherents to Islam in a country affect the share of women in lower and single houses of parliament?
3. Does real GDP per capita have an impact on the share of women in lower and single houses of parliament?


### Empirical Hypotheses

Higher degrees of democracy may lead to more open political structures and, as a result, a higher proportion of women in lower and single houses of parliament. We hypothesize that greater levels of democracy will result in a higher proportion of women serving in the lower and single houses of parliament.
  
The proportion of women in the lower and single houses of parliament may be lower in nations with greater percentages of Muslims due to cultural or religious norms that restrict women's involvement in politics. We therefore hypothesize that there will be fewer women in lower and single houses of parliament in nations with greater rates of Islamic adherents.




## Methods 



### Regressionanalyisis




```{r Load TS Data and Regressions, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

source("../code/regression.R")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

captions <- c("(a) Regression Analysis by Level of Democracy",
              "(b) Regression Analysis by % of adherents to Islam",
              "(c) Regression Analysis by GPD per Capita",
              "(d) Regression Analysis by All Independent Variables")

```


<!-- 
```{r Regression side by side, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.cap='Regression Plots I', fig.subcap=captions[1:2]}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
#Level of Democracy 
ggplot(data_ts_2, aes(x = fh_ipolity2, y = ipu_l_sw)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Level of Democracy (Freedom House/Imputed Polity)", y = "Share of Women (Lower and Single Houses)")+
  ggtitle("Regression Analysis by Level of Democracy")


#Islam: Total (%Adherents)
ggplot(data_ts_2, aes(x = arda_isgenpct, y = ipu_l_sw)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Islam: Total (% Adherents)s", y = "Share of Women (Lower and Single Houses)")+
  ggtitle("Regression Analysis by % of adherents to Islam")

```

```{r Part 2 Regressions, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.cap='Regression Plots II',fig.subcap=captions[3:4]}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
#Real GDP per Capita
ggplot(data_ts_2, aes(x = mad_gdppc, y = ipu_l_sw)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita", y = "Share of Women (Lower and Single Houses)")+
  ggtitle("Regression Analysis by GPD per Capita")
# All independent variables 
ggplot(data_ts_2, aes(x = arda_isgenpct+fh_ipolity2+mad_gdppc, y = ipu_l_sw)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Independent Variables", y = "Share of Women (Lower and Single Houses)")+
  ggtitle("Regression Analysis by All Independent Variables")



```

```{r Stargazer Regressionanalysis, results='asis'}
#Load package "labelled" to generate table
library(stargazer)

#Generate a well-formatted table
stargazer(regression_a, regression_b, regression_c, 
          title="Regression on the Share of Women in Parliament (Lower and Single Houses) ", 
          dep.var.caption="", 
          dep.var.labels.include=FALSE,
          covariate.labels=c("Islam","Level of Democracy", "Real GDP per Capita"), 
          digits=2,
          keep.stat=c("rsq", "adj.rsq", "n"), 
          notes=c("Notes: Standard errors in parentheses."), 
          notes.align = "c", 
          notes.label="",
          no.space=TRUE,
          type = 'latex')
```




## Visualizations

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
